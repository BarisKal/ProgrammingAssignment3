# Getting and Cleaning Data (Programming Assignment 3)
This respository contains the submissions for the third programming assignment (Getting and Cleaning Data) of the Data Science Specialization.

# Preface
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

# Prerequisite
To be able to work with the uploaded R-Script [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/BarisKal/ProgrammingAssignment3/blob/master/run_analysis.R), you have to download the [project data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) in your working data.

# Project Summary
The following is a summary about the project instructions.

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Code Book
For further information there is a [Code Book](https://github.com/BarisKal/ProgrammingAssignment3/blob/master/CodeBook.md) which describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
